\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, both proposed models demonstrated satisfactory performance,
with the RF model consistently outperforming the LR model, aligning with
previous findings~\cite{CHIEW2019153, SAHINGOZ2019345}. Despite the substantial
increase in features (over 60\%) in the custom set, the performance achieved
by models trained on both sets was statistically indistinguishable.

Future enhancements could focus on addressing the sensitivity of threshold-based
features to erroneous choices. Converting these features to min-max-scaled float
values could mitigate this issue and improve compatibility with linear or
gradient-descent-based algorithms. Additionally, the custom set includes
several features that exhibit linear dependence on others, shown in~\autoref{fig:feature-correlation}.
Dimensionality reduction techniques could be employed to map these linearly dependent features
into a new feature, potentially reducing the computational resources required
for model training.
